pazpar2 TYPO3 extension
=======================

A TYPO3 extension to include a bibliographic metasearch with Index Data’s
`pazpar2 <http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2/>`__ software on web pages.

Created by `SUB Göttingen <http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/>`__

Feel free to send in comments or contribute improvements. You can fork
the extension’s `repository at
github <https://github.com/subugoe/typo3-pazpar2>`__.


Introduction
------------

`pazpar2 <http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2/>`__ is a bibliographic
metasearch software by Index Data for querying multiple Solr, SRU and
Z39.50 servers, normalising, merging and deduplicating the results and
providing them for presentation.

The pazpar2 TYPO3 extension provides three plug-ins for content elements
that let the user initiate search queries and display the results:

-  *pazpar2* offering a standard search interface for a pazpar2 service
   with a search field and extended search options
-  *pazpar2 Service Proxy* the same search interface for pazpar2
   accessed through Service Proxy
-  *pazpar2neuerwerbungen* which offers checkboxes, the state of which
   determines the search queries (this has been designed for the
   specific needs of SUB Göttingen, relies on the nkwgok subject tree
   TYPO3 extension and is unlikely to be useful elsewhere)

You can see the extension in use at the Library of Anglo-American
Culture site which uses the *pazpar2* plug-in on its `home
page <http://aac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/>`__ and the
*pazpar2neuerwerbungen* plug-in on its `New Acquisitions
page <http://aac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/new/>`__.


Requirements
------------

To use this extension successfully you need:

TYPO3
~~~~~

-  TYPO3 ≥ 6.2.0
-  at least jQuery 1.7.1 (compatible with jQuery ≥ 1.9) on your pages;
   use the t3jquery extension for that

   - when using autocomplete you need jQuery UI with the Autocomplete,
     Menu and Position modules
   - make sure you have the CSS for a jQuery UI theme included in your
     site to get a correct look

-  pazpar2 ≥ 1.6.2

   - The extension works pretty well with the metadata fields created by
     pazpar2’s tmarc.xsl. See the section `pazpar2 Setup <#pazpar2-setup>`__
     for additional metadata features supported by the extension.

For using this extension directly from git, be sure to run
git submodule update --init
after cloning this extension.

pazpar2
~~~~~~~

For searches to work and results to be displayed correctly with the
*pazpar2* plug-in you need pazpar2 ≥ 1.6.2 available at a URL on your
webserver (by default at the path /pazpar2/search.pz2, see `Index Data’s
instructions on how to proxy it
there <http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2/doc/installation.apache2proxy.html>`__).

The plug-in supports displaying additional access information as
provided by the `pazpar2-access
proxy <https://github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-access>`__.

pazpar2 Service Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For searches to work and results to be displayed correctly with the
*pazpar2 Service Proxy* plug-in, you need pazpar2 ≥ 1.6.2 available
through Service Proxy at a URL on your webserver (by default at the path
/service-proxy/ for the service itself and /service-proxy-auth for
authentication).

pazpar2 Neuerwerbungen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the pazpar2-neuerwerbungen plug-in to be useful you additionally
need:

-  nkwgok extension
-  subject hierarchies that are children of the PPN »NE« imported into
   the nkwgok extension

   -  The extension is designed primarily for the case where just two
      levels of hierarchy exist. The elements on level 1 provide
      grouping with a label, those on level two the child elements of a
      group. If the parent element has a blank search query, its search
      query is generated by OR-ing the queries of all child elements
      together. To avoid having complex queries, a simpler query giving
      the same result set can be explicitly provided. Child elements may
      not have exactly the same search query as their parent element.

-  if you want to provide RSS feeds for new acquisitions, a script
   accepting queries in the »q« parameter is expected at the path
   /opac.atom. See the
   `Opac-2-Atom <https://github.com/subugoe/Opac-2-Atom>`__ project for an
   example script converting Göttingen’s Pica Opac output to Atom.


Setup
-----

Insert the pazpar2 [Neuerwerbungen\|Service Proxy] content element where
you need it and make sure the pazpar2 Settings static include is added
for the relevant pages. Looking at the `illustrated setup
example <https://github.com/subugoe/typo3-pazpar2/blob/master/Documentation/Setup.md>`__
may make this easier.

Flex Form
~~~~~~~~~

Flex Form configuration is available for the pazpar2 and pazpar2
Neuerwerbungen content elements and offers the following options. The
name of the corresponding TypoScript parameter is noted in [].

-  pazpar2 service ID [``serviceID``\ ]: needs to be the name of a
   service set up on your pazpar2 server or empty if there is only a
   single unnamed service running
-  Google Books [``useGoogleBooks``\ ]: Choose whether the extension
   should try to look up all records with ISBN and OCLC numbers on
   Google books once the full record is revealed and try to display the
   cover art and offer the book preview if possible. If this option is
   turned on, the plug-in will load and run a JavaScript from Google’s
   servers on the page the content element is inserted in.
-  Journals Online & Print [``useZDB``\ ]: Choose whether the extension
   should try to look up all records with ISSN numbers using ZDB’s
   Journals Online & Print (JOP) service. If this option is turned on,
   the plug-in will load information about journal availability from the
   ZDB Proxy on your server (see the next option) to display the
   availability of the journal.
-  ZDB Proxy [``ZDBIP``\ ]: You can set up two distinct proxies for the
   ZDB JOP service if you plan to use it. The one available at the path
   /zdb/ on your server should pass the user’s IP address to the ZDB JOP
   service, thus returning the journal availability for the user’s
   current location. The one available at /zdb-local/ will do the lookup
   for the server’s IP address – with the intention to provide
   availability information for the institution running the server. This
   option lets you pick which of the proxies will be used for the ZDB
   JOP lookup. Either proxy configuration needs to contain the sid
   parameter with your service name. [`Apache configuration file for
   setting up the
   proxies <https://raw.github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-extras/master/fileadmin/apache/zdb.conf>`__\ ]
-  Histogram [``useHistogramForYearFacets``\ ]: The extension displays
   year facets if results from more than a few years are displayed.
   Choose whether the year facets should be displayed graphically using
   a histogram rather than as an (incomplete) list of year numbers in
   modern browsers.
-  Subjects for pazpar2 Neuerwerbungen [``neuerwerbungen-subjects``\ ]:
   A subject has to be picked in the popup menu if you want to use the
   pazpar2 Neuerwerbungen plug-in. The popup menu is populated using
   child elements of the PPN »NE« in the subject hierarchy of the nkwgok
   extension. This is probably useful for SUB Göttingen use only.

TypoScript
~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the options exposed in the flexform, a number of
additional options can be set using TypoScript in
``plugin.tx_pazpar2.settings``. The default value is noted inside []
after the option name.

-  pazpar2 configuration:

   -  ``pazpar2Path`` [/pazpar2/search.pz2]: absolute path to pazpar2
      service on the web server

-  Search form:

   -  ``showSearchForm`` [1]: if 1, the search form is shown in the
      pazpar2 plug-in; turning off the search form still provides the
      pazpar2 search and result display capabilities which you may want
      to trigger from your own component
   -  ``autcompleteURLs`` []: an array with keys: field names (e.g. all,
      title, person) and values: URLs to which the search term can be
      appended to create a query for an autocompletion list.
   -  ``autocompleteSetupFunction`` []: name of a JavaScript
      ``function (URL, fieldName) that is run when setting up the autocomplete feature. Returns an object for configuring [jQuery UI’s autocomplete widget](http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/). Functions``\ autocompleteSetupArray\ ``for sources that return JSON arrays and``\ autocompleteSolrSpellcheck\`
      for querying a Solr spellcheck component are predefined.
   -  ``allowExtendedSearch`` [1]: if 1, the link to show the extended
      search form is displayed
   -  ``fulltextSearch`` [0]: configure checkbox to do full text search
      in the extended search form; 0 -> not shown, 1 -> labelled for
      full text search, 2 -> labelled for table of contents search
   -  ``journalTitleOnlySearch`` [0]: if 1, the checkbox to search
      journal titles only is displayed in the extended search form
   -  ``dateSearch`` [1]: if 1, the date field is displayed in the
      extended search form
   -  ``useSortMenu`` [0]: if 1 a HTML select element letting the user
      pick the sort order is included in the search form
   -  ``sortOrder`` [{1.fieldName = date 1.direction = descending}]: the
      sort order to use; the array may have additional entries to
      determine the sort order in the case of equality of the precedeing
      criteria; The fieldNames must be set up in the pazpar2 service’s
      metadata configuration. More complex example: {1.fieldName = date
      1.direction = descending2.fieldName = author 2.direction =
      ascending 3.fieldName = title 3.direction = ascending 4.fieldname
      = title-number-section \` 4.direction = ascending}
   -  ``triggeredByNKWGOK`` [0]: if 1, search will be triggered by
      selections from subject hierarchies displayed by the nkwgok
      extension (presumably useful for SUB Göttingen setup only)
   -  Override localisations: Using
      ``plugin.tx_pazpar2._LOCAL_LANG.[en|default]``, the strings used
      in the search form can be overwritten; You can override the
      strings in Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xml, as well as
      those in the ``localisations`` object at the end of
      Resources/Public/pz2-client/pz2-client.js and the objects
      ``linkDescriptions``, ``mediaTypeNames``, ``catalogueNames`` (by
      prefixing their keys with ``link-description-``, ``media-type-``
      and ``catalogue-name-`` respectively. Example:
      ``plugin.tx_pazpar2._LOCAL_LANG.en.link-description-Link = Go to Resource``.

-  Results display

   -  ``resultsPerPage`` [100]: number of results to display on each
      page. Should be one of 10, 20, 50, 100 if you plan to let users
      select the number
   -  ``useMaps`` [1]: if 1, enables the display of Google Maps with
      markers for areas covered by the record displayed
   -  ``provideCOinSExport`` [1]: if 1, causes invisible
      `COinS <http://ocoins.info/>`__ metadata to be inserted into the
      result lists. It will be used by
      `Zotero <http://www.zotero.org/>`__ to automatically find
      bibliographic records displayed in the page. Note that Zotero 3 is
      the first version capable of discovering COinS data that are
      dynamically added to the page.
   -  ``exportFormats`` [{ris = 0bibtex = 0}]: an array with export
      format names as keys. Set the value to 1/0 to enable/disable a
      specific format. For active formats links to downloads of
      bibliographic metadata are added to the detail view of records.
      Permitted keys are: ``ris``, ``bibtex``, ``ris-inline`` and
      ``bibtex-inline`` for
      `RIS <http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp>`__ and
      BibTeX formats. The plain names cause a download of the file, the
      ``-inline`` names replace the current page with the bibliographic
      data.
   -  ``showKVKLink`` [0]: for records with an ISBN or media type book a
      link to the metasearch across German union catalogues in
      `Karlsruhe Virtual
      Catalogue <http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/kvk.html>`__ (KVK) is
      added along with the export links
   -  ``useKeywords`` [0]: if 1, the Keywords search field is offered in
      extended search and keywords are displayed in result details, each
      linking to a search for the keyword in question; requires
      pazpar2’s targets to be configured for keyword searches on the
      »subject« index
   -  ``termLists`` [{xtargets {maxFetch = 25 minDisplay = 1} medium
      {maxFetch = 12 minDisplay = 1} language {maxFetch = 5 minDisplay =
      1} filterDate {maxFetch = 10 minDisplay = 1}}]: Configuration
      which facets will be displayed. Set up an array with the pazpar2
      metadata field names as keys and arrays as values. The arrays
      contain the key ``maxFetch`` with value the maximum number of
      facet items to display and the key ``minDisplay`` with value the
      minimum number of facets required for this facet to appear. The
      ``filterDate`` facet used by default is generated automatically by
      the script from the date field.

-  included files:

   -  ``CSSPath`` [EXT:pazpar2/Resources/Public/pz2-client/pz2.css]: CSS
      file included to style the search form and search results
   -  ``pz2JSPath`` [EXT:pazpar2/Resources/Public/pz2-client/pz2.js]:
      Index Data’s
      `pz2.js <http://git.indexdata.com/?p=pazpar2.git;a=blob_plain;f=js/pz2.js;hb=HEAD>`__
      library to communicate with the pazar2 service
   -  ``pz2-clientJSPath``
      [EXT:pazpar2/Resources/Public/pz2-client/pz2-client.js]:
      JavaScript handling the user interaction and display of results; a
      lot of the customisation is in here

pazpar2 Setup
-------------

pazpar2 services used by the extension need to have specific settings
for the search keys as well as for the metadata they provide for the
searches to work and the quality of the displayed data to be reasonable.

Search keys
~~~~~~~~~~~

The search forms provided by pazpar2 use the following search keys which
must be set up in the pazpar2 service:

-  ``term`` - for default search
-  ``fulltext`` - for fulltext/toc search (use same as term if not
   available) [optional]
-  ``title``
-  ``journal`` - for journal title search [optional]
-  ``person``
-  ``date``
-  ``nel`` - month index required by pazpar2 Neuerwerbungen only
   (required format: ``YYYYMM``)
-  ``subject`` [optional]

Sorting
~~~~~~~

The standard configuration requires the pazpar2 service to support
sorting by the metadata fields ``date``. It can be reconfigured using
the ``sortOrder`` TypoScript setting.

For example – if you have those fields set up in your metadata
configuration – you get better results by using ``date``, ``author``,
``title``, ``title-number-section`` using the TypoScript setup:

::

        plugin.tx_pazpar2.settings.sortOrder {
            1.fieldName = date
            1.direction = descending
            2.fieldName = author
            2.direction = ascending
            3.fieldName = title
            3.direction = ascending
            4.fieldName = title-number-section
            4.direction = ascending
        }

Metadata format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The metadata expected by the extension to display results are based on
the metadata fields created by Indexdata’s powerful
`tmarc.xsl <http://git.indexdata.com/?p=pazpar2.git;a=blob_plain;f=etc/tmarc.xsl;hb=HEAD>`__
style file for extracting information from Marc records. A few additions
and changes to the standard output of that stylesheet have been made to
improve the display quality.

Fields used to display data if present:

-  id
-  medium
-  title
-  title-remainder
-  title-number-section
-  title-responsibility
-  date
-  multivolume-title (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  series-title
-  author
-  other-person (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  journal-title
-  journal-subpart
-  volume-number
-  issue-number
-  pages-number
-  isbn
-  issn
-  pissn (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  eissn (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  oclc-number
-  zdb-number
-  doi (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  electronic-url
-  edition
-  publication-name
-  publication-place
-  physical-extent
-  description
-  language - ISO 639-2/B language code (not part of standard
   tmarc.xsl), German and English language names are included in the
   JavaScript
-  abstract (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  creator (used for Guide links)
-  catalogue-url (URL linking to the catalogue web page for that record,
   built using the stylesheets and setup for the various targets.)
-  parent-catalogue-url (URL linking to the catalogue web page for
   related records to the current record, typically the containing
   parent collection.)
-  subject
-  classification-msc (not part of standard tmarc.xsl)
-  mapscale (not part of standard tmarc.xsl), display the scale of maps
   and potentially draw the region covered by the map on an interactive
   map on the web page
-  country (not part of standard tmarc.xsl, used for Guide records)
-  source-type (not part of standard tmarc.xsl, used for Guide records)

For the 'medium' field, the supported types (with a localised name and
icon) are. Most of them come from standard tmarc.xsl analysis of MARC
records. A few depend on our refinements of tmarc.xsl and additional
information/analysis.

-  article
-  audio-visual (may require tmarc.xsl output to be stripped of more
   specific media type information like dvd)
-  book
-  data (not part of tmarc.xsl)
-  electronic
-  image (not part of tmarc.xsl)
-  journal
-  letter (not part of tmarc.xsl)
-  manuscript (changed tmarc.xsl to recognise these)
-  map
-  microform
-  music-score
-  multivolume (extended tmarc.xsl to recognise these)
-  newspaper
-  recording
-  website (used for websites as found in SUB’s SSG-FI Guides, not
   coming from tmarc.xsl)
-  multiple (used for merged records of varying media types as well as
   mixed-media items)

To get a better idea of the general setup, take a look at `our setup
files <https://github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-SUB>`__, particularly the `AAC
service <https://github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-SUB/blob/master/services/AAC.xml>`__
and the `gbv-sru-neu
target <https://github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-SUB/blob/master/settings/gbv-sru-neu.xml>`__.
Some of `our
stylesheets <https://github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-SUB/tree/master/xsl>`__ may
be helpful as well, particularly those for `ISO 639-2
cleaning <https://raw.github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-SUB/master/xsl/language-code-cleaner.xsl>`__
and `ISO 639-1 to 639-2/B
conversion <https://raw.github.com/subugoe/pazpar2-SUB/master/xsl/iso-639-1-to-639-2b.xsl>`__.


Bibliographic data export
-------------------------

To create proper downloads these are created in a slightly involved way
by sending the pazpar2 metadata back to server where the script
Resources/Public/pz2-client/converter/convert-pazpar2-record.php is run.

Conversions done by that script use the stylesheets in
Resources/Public/pz2-client/converter. The conversion quality achieved
by those scripts is somewhat limited on a syntactic level due to the
inadequacies (RIS is defined to be
`non-Unicode <http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_fields_02.asp>`__
but we, like many others, send UTF-8 to accomodate non-Latin references
as well) or complexities (getting BibTeX escaping right is a major
effort [and occasionally undesirable as some mathematical sites includ
TeX code which benefits from not being escaped] so the lazy compromise
is to send UTF-8 as well).

Support for additional formats can be added to the extension by adding
an XSL file to the Resources/Public/pz2-client/converter folder,
registering it for a format name in the Array the beginning of
Resources/Public/pz2-client/converter/convert-pazpar2-record.php and
adding the display strings for that format to
Resources/Public/pz2-client/pz2-client.js as well as to
Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xml
